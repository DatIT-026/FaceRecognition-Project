# ⚠️ Support for the Facial Recognition Project will end in February 2025
After February 9, 2025, We will no longer provide security updates or technical support for the Facial Recognition Project.

## Info
This is the 7th project in my **Crazy Gifts** series. We are proud to introduce *The Facial Recognition Project*, designed to perform face recognition using pre-trained, all implemented in JavaScript. Dive in and explore the classic methods of web-based AI!

### How to use it?
Follow the trial link provided below or [click me](https://datit-026.github.io/FaceRecognition-Project/), wait for a short time while the system loads the models, and then upload a photo of a person for the system to recognize.

Unfortunately, the project can only recognize 5 predefined models stored in our database. As this is a research-focused project, errors, and limitations are to be expected.
