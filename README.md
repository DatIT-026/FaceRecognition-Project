# Support for the Facial Recognition Project will end in February 2025
After February 9, 2025, We will no longer provide security updates or technical support for the Facial Recognition Project.

## Info
This is the 7th project in my Crazy Gifts series, and this time, we are proud to introduce *The Facial Recognition Project*.  
This project has no fixed timeline, but we typically conclude a project after 1 to 2 years, with a minimum duration of 6 months. Projects deemed unsuitable or harmful will be immediately canceled and removed.

### How to use it?
Follow the trial link provided below or [click me](https://datit-026.github.io/FaceRecognition-Project/), wait for a short time while the system loads the models, and then upload a photo of a person for the system to recognize.

Unfortunately, the project can only recognize 5 predefined models stored in our database. As this is a research-focused project, errors, and limitations are to be expected.
